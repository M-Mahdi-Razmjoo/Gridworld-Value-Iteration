# Gridworld Value Iteration & Q-Value Calculation

This repository contains an implementation of **Value Iteration** in a Gridworld environment using **Bellman Equations**. The goal is to compute the **V-value** and **Q-value** for each state and verify their equivalence. The best action for each state is identified based on the computed Q-values.

## Objectives
- Implement **V(s)** and **Q(s, a)** calculations for an $(n_{row} \times n_{col})$ Gridworld.
- Verify the equivalence of **V(s)** and **Q(s, a)** using **Bellman Equations**.
- Identify the optimal policy by selecting the best action for each state.
